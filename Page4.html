            <span> Ohi Day </span> is celebrated throughout Greece, Cyprus and the Greek communities around the world on 28 October each year. Ohi Day commemorates the rejection by the Greek dictator Ioannis Metaxas of the ultimatum made by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini on 28 October 1940 and the subsequent Hellenic counterattack against the invading Italian forces at the mountains of Pindus during the Greco-Italian War and Greek resistance during the Axis occupation.

            The <span> Greek Dark Ages </span>, began in 1200 BCE and lasted until 800 BCE at the start of the Archaic Period. This period of time is associated with archeological evidence such as graves and pottery, which showed a decline in the wealth, art, writing, and culture associated with Bronze Age civilizations.

            <span> Archaic </span> was coined in the 18th century by art historians in order to describe the transition of the Greek art between the Geometric (9th-8th century BC) and the Classical Period (5th-4th century BC). The Archaic Period covered roughly a time span from the 7th to the 6th century BC (700-500 BC).

            <span> Classical Greece or Classical Period </span> Classical Greece was a period of around 200 years (the 5th and 4th centuries BC) in Ancient Greece, marked by much of the eastern Aegean and northern regions of Greek culture (such as Ionia and Macedonia) gaining increased autonomy from the Persian Empire; the peak flourishing of democratic Athens; the First and Second Peloponnesian Wars; the Spartan and then Theban hegemonies; and the expansion of Macedonia under Philip II.

            <span> Roman Greece </span> refers to the period when the ancient Greek region was conquered and controlled by the Roman Empire, essentially encompassing the territory of modern-day Greece under Roman rule, where Greek culture heavily influenced Roman society, particularly after the Roman victory at the Battle of Corinth in 146 BC; this era is often characterized by a blending of Greek and Roman customs and is sometimes called the "Greco-Roman" period.
